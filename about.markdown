Hello! My name is Tamir! I am a Fall 2025 graduate of Towson University where I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I have a passion for creating new software ideas and side projects to keep up with trends in tech and learn engineering practices that I can employ in my career. Read through some posts on projects I've taken on throughout my career and let me know what you think!
